Ever wanted to make blocks of something, but found that you couldn't? Enchanted books or potions clogging up your chests? Look no further, as Everything Blocks lets you make blocks out of any item except other blocks (for now). All mods are supported, not just Vanilla stuff. Everything Blocks has WAILA integration, too! Note that the block recipes will not override existing block recipes or recipes where the item is crafted 2x2 or 3x3 to make something by default.
